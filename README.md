=============
This repo is where I stick code I am having a play with, or simple demos I want to share with students / course attendees.

Each solution usually demonstrates a single point.

The UI won't be pretty.

The code won't be perfect. It might be buggy. It may not even work.

If I've sent you here, I hope you find something useful.
